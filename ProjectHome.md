The title of my project report is "Resource Allocation in an Artificial Electronic Market".

Here's the abstract.

The allocation of resources in a large organisation can be an inefficient exercise constrained by poor sources of information and assorted human factors.  Markets and financial instruments such as derivatives exhibit desirable properties in conveying information to market participants as well as mitigating risk.  An automated system for simulating the trade and consumption of futures resource contracts between software agents is presented and implemented.  The performance of different transactions is shown and a relationship between a trading constraint and trading activity are presented as results.
